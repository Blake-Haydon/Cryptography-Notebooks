# Cryptography Notebooks

## Hash Based Signatures

- [Lamport Signatures](https://github.com/Blake-Haydon/Lamport-Signatures): One-time signatures
- [Winternitz Signatures](https://github.com/Blake-Haydon/Winternitz-Signatures): One-time signatures

## Secret Sharing

- [Distributed Point Functions](https://github.com/Blake-Haydon/Distributed-Point-Functions): An application of Function Secret Sharing (FSS)
- [Shamir Secret Sharing](https://github.com/Blake-Haydon/Shamir-Secret-Sharing): Share a secret between `n` parties where `t` of them are required to reconstruct the secret

## Numerical Tools

- [Polynomial Interpolation](https://github.com/Blake-Haydon/Polynomial-Interpolation): Interpolate a polynomial from a set of points

## Protocols

- [Private Multiparty State Machine](https://github.com/Blake-Haydon/Private-Multiparty-State-Machine): A novel protocol for running a state machine where inputs and state are private throughout execution (only the final state is public)
